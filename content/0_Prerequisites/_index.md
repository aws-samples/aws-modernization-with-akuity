## What You'll Build on AWS

In this workshop, you'll create a complete GitOps workflow on AWS using:

1. **Amazon EKS** - AWS's managed Kubernetes service
2. **Argo CD** - Declarative, GitOps continuous delivery for Kubernetes
3. **Kargo** - Streamlined promotion workflows across AWS environments
4. **KubeVision** - Advanced monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities for EKS

All of these components work together on AWS, with the Akuity Platform integrating seamlessly with Amazon EKS through the AWS Marketplace.
